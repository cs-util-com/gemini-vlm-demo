## ðŸ“‹ Manual Testing Checklist (for user)

To manually test the implementation:

### Setup
- [ ] Clone repository
- [ ] Start local web server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`)
- [ ] Open http://localhost:8000 in browser
- [ ] Obtain Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
- [ ] Prepare 5-10 test images

### Single Image Test (Backwards Compatibility)
- [ ] Enter API key
- [ ] Select 1 image
- [ ] Verify analysis runs automatically
- [ ] Check canvas shows image with overlays
- [ ] Verify report appears below canvas
- [ ] Test hover interactions

### Multi-Image Test
- [ ] Select 5 images
- [ ] Verify progress bar appears
- [ ] Check gallery displays all thumbnails
- [ ] Watch status chips update (queued â†’ analyzing â†’ completed)
- [ ] Click different thumbnails
- [ ] Verify canvas switches images
- [ ] Check session report appears after completion
- [ ] Verify session overview shows aggregates
- [ ] Test export JSON button
- [ ] Test export CSV button
- [ ] Open exported files to verify content

### Error Handling Test
- [ ] Test with invalid API key (expect error)
- [ ] Test with >20 images (expect error message)
- [ ] Test with corrupted image file
- [ ] Verify partial success handling

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with exactly 20 images (max limit)
- [ ] Test with very large images (>10MB)
- [ ] Test rapid thumbnail switching
- [ ] Test during network disconnect

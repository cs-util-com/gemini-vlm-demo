## Changes Summary

### API Configuration
- Model: `gemini-2.5-pro` â†’ `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Added: `temperature: 0.5`
- Added: `thinking_config: { thinking_budget: 0 }`

### Schema Simplification
- Lines: 142 â†’ 45 (68% reduction)
- Removed complex nested structures
- Removed enums with 5+ values
- Removed minItems/maxItems constraints
- Added `mask` and `points` fields

### Prompt Optimization

- Removed subsections (Geometry, Safety, Progress, etc.)
- Added explicit format specification
- Added item limit (25 items)
- Added "no code fences" instruction

### New Features
1. **Segmentation Masks**
   - Base64-encoded PNG masks
   - Colored overlays at 50% opacity
   - Category-based coloring
   - Scaled to bounding box dimensions

2. **Points**
   - [y, x] coordinate pairs
   - Circular markers (6px radius)
   - White borders for visibility
   - Category-based coloring

### Backward Compatibility
- Conversion function maintains old format
- All existing tests pass (122 tests)
- Code coverage maintained (97.7%)
- No breaking changes

## Reference Implementation Analysis

Based on: `/referenceImplementations/genini-spatial-understanding-demo`

### Key Learnings
1. **Model Choice**: gemini-2.5-flash is optimized for spatial tasks
2. **Thinking Config**: Disabling thinking improves spatial accuracy
3. **Temperature**: 0.5 provides consistent, reproducible results
4. **Prompt Style**: Direct task description > role-playing
5. **Schema Complexity**: Minimal schemas avoid "too many states" errors
6. **Output Control**: Explicit "no prose, no code fences" prevents wrapper text

### Their Implementation
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Thinking: Disabled (`thinkingBudget: 0`)
- Temperature: 0.5
- Downscale: 640px max
- Prompts: Simple, task-focused
- Response: Direct JSON arrays

### Our Adaptation
- âœ… Adopted their model choice
- âœ… Adopted their thinking config
- âœ… Adopted their temperature
- âœ… Simplified our schema to match their style
- âœ… Simplified our prompts to match their style
- âœ… Added conversion layer for backward compatibility
- âœ… Enhanced with single-call multi-feature support

## Testing & Validation

### Tests
- âœ… 122 tests pass
- âœ… 5 test suites pass
- âœ… 97.7% statement coverage
- âœ… No test failures
- âœ… No regression

### Quality Checks
- âœ… Linting: 0 errors (11 pre-existing complexity warnings)
- âœ… Duplication: 0 clones found
- âœ… Circular Dependencies: 0 found
- âœ… Boundary Violations: 0 found

### Commands Run
```bash
npm ci                    # Clean install
npm test                  # All tests pass
npm run lint             # No errors
npm run check:dup        # No duplicates
npm run check:cycles     # No cycles
npm run check:boundaries # No violations

```

## Expected Improvements

### Performance
- âš¡ Faster response times (Flash is faster than Pro)
- ðŸŽ¯ More accurate bounding boxes (optimized model + config)
- ðŸ’° Lower API costs (single call vs 3 calls)
- ðŸ“‰ Reduced token usage (simpler prompt + schema)

### Features
- âœ¨ Segmentation masks for precise object boundaries
- âœ¨ Points for marking specific locations
- âœ¨ All features in single API call (3x efficiency)
- âœ¨ Better UX with visual overlays

### Reliability
- ðŸ”’ Avoids "too many states" schema errors
- ðŸ”’ More consistent outputs (temperature + simplified schema)
- ðŸ”’ Cleaner responses (no code fences)
- ðŸ”’ Better rate limiting (fewer calls)

## Migration Notes

### For Users
- **No action required** - Changes are transparent
- Upload images as usual
- Masks and points render automatically if present
- All existing features continue to work

### For Developers
- **No API changes** - Conversion layer handles format differences
- All existing code continues to work
- New features available automatically
- Tests confirm backward compatibility

### For Maintainers
- Review `docs/spatial-understanding-improvements.md` for details
- Schema can be further simplified if needed
- Prompt can be tuned for specific use cases
- Conversion layer can be removed if old format is deprecated

# Interactive Report UI - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Feature:** Interactive Report UI for AEC Vision Analysis  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and Tested

---

## Overview

Added a comprehensive interactive report UI that displays structured analysis results between the canvas and raw JSON output. The report provides a user-friendly view of detections, safety issues, progress insights, and aggregated statistics.

---

## Design Decisions

Based on user preferences, implemented the following design:

1. **Layout**: Multiple independently collapsible sections (1b)
2. **Detections**: Cards in a grid layout with category color coding (2a)
3. **Interaction**: Hover over detection cards highlights canvas overlays (3a)
4. **Safety**: Separate prominent section at top with severity badges (4a)
5. **Progress**: Progress bars with phase labels and percentages (5a)
6. **Aggregates**: Client-side calculation + CSS bar chart visualization (6b)

---

## Key Features

### 1. Report Sections

#### üö® Safety Issues (Always Expanded)
- Grid layout with severity-based color coding
- High (red), Medium (orange), Low (yellow) badges
- Shows: label, rule violated, confidence percentage
- Hover highlights bounding box on canvas

#### üìä Progress (Collapsible)
- **Regional Progress**: For localized detections with `category: "progress"`
- **Overall Progress**: From `global_insights` 
- Visual progress bars with completion percentages
- Phase names, notes, and confidence levels

#### üîç All Detections (Collapsible)
- Grid of cards for every detection
- Left border color-coding by category:
  - Yellow: Objects
  - Cyan: Facility Assets
  - Red: Safety Issues
  - Green: Progress
- Shows: label, confidence, category badge, custom attributes
- Hover interaction highlights on canvas

#### üí° Global Insights (Collapsible)
- Cards for whole-image observations
- Name, description, confidence
- Metrics display for quantitative insights

#### üìà Summary Statistics (Collapsible)
- **Client-side calculated** (prevents LLM hallucination)
- Bar charts with visual width proportional to counts
- Two views:
  - By Category (with category color coding)
  - By Label (top 10, sorted by count)

### 2. Interactive Features

- **Hover to Highlight**: Mouse over any detection card highlights its overlay on canvas with glow effect
- **Collapsible Sections**: Click headers to expand/collapse
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlighted cards show border color change and elevation
- **Smooth Transitions**: Progress bars and toggles animate

### 3. Visual Design

- Dark theme consistent with existing UI
- Color-coded categories for quick recognition
- High contrast for accessibility
- Responsive grid layouts (auto-fill, min 280px columns)
- Shadow effects on hover for depth perception

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created

1. **`src/report-ui.js`** (~350 lines)
   - `calculateAggregates(detections)` - Client-side aggregation
   - `renderReportUI(data, onHover, onLeave)` - Main render function
   - `setupReportInteractions(container, detections, onHover, onLeave)` - Event handlers
   - Section-specific renderers: `renderSafetyCards()`, `renderProgressSection()`, etc.

2. **`src/report-ui.test.js`** 
   - Tests for aggregate calculation
   - Ensures counts are accurate and prevent hallucination

### Modified Files

1. **`index.html`**
   - Added `#reportWrap` container between canvas and JSON output
   - Added comprehensive CSS styles (~150 lines) for report components

2. **`src/index.js`**
   - Import `renderReportUI` and `setupReportInteractions`
   - Added state tracking: `currentDetections`, `currentParsedData`, `highlightedDetectionId`
   - New `drawOverlays()` function for re-rendering with highlights
   - Updated analyze button handler to render report and wire interactions
   - Added `clearReport()` helper

3. **`src/aec-schema.js`**
   - Removed `aggregates` from schema (now client-side)
   - Removed aggregates mention from prompt
   - Updated `required` array to exclude `aggregates`

4. **`README.md`**
   - Added new **Section 7: Interactive Report UI** with full documentation
   - Updated section numbers (8-19)
   - Noted client-side aggregate calculation
   - Updated UI/UX interaction descriptions

---

## Schema Changes

### Removed: `aggregates` Object

**Before:**
```json
{
  "aggregates": {
    "countsByLabel": [...],
    "countsByCategory": [...]
  }
}
```

**After:**
- Removed from schema
- Calculated client-side from `detections` array
- Prevents LLM from hallucinating incorrect counts

**Rationale:** LLMs can make counting errors. By calculating aggregates client-side from the actual detections array, we ensure 100% accuracy.

---

## Code Quality

### Test Coverage
- ‚úÖ All existing tests pass (71 tests)
- ‚úÖ New tests added for `calculateAggregates()`
- ‚úÖ Coverage: 99.15% statements, 96.85% branches

### Linting
- ‚úÖ No ESLint errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 3 complexity warnings (pre-existing, acceptable for demo)
- ‚úÖ No circular dependencies
- ‚úÖ No code duplication

---

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Safety First**: Critical safety issues prominently displayed at top
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Non-critical sections collapsed by default
3. **Visual Feedback**: Hover interactions connect report cards to canvas overlays
4. **Scannable**: Grid layouts and color coding enable quick information scanning
5. **Flexible**: Users can collapse sections to focus on canvas or raw JSON

---

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6 module support
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- No external dependencies
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)

---

## Performance

- Minimal DOM updates (render once after API call)
- CSS transitions for smooth animations
- Event delegation where appropriate
- No unnecessary re-renders

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for v2:

1. **Search/Filter**: Filter detections by category, confidence threshold, or label
2. **Sorting**: Sort detections by confidence, label, category
3. **Export**: Download report as PDF or formatted HTML
4. **Compare**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple images
5. **Annotations**: Allow users to add notes to detections
6. **Zoom**: Click detection card to zoom canvas to that region
7. **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys to navigate between detection cards
